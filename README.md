# Hi, I’m Hylke 👋☕

Flutter-first developer with a strong focus on **production-ready code, long-term maintainability, and clear architecture**.

I like systems that still make sense a year from now.
I dislike clever code that only works because everyone is afraid to touch it.

## About me

I’m 22 years old and have been writing Flutter for **~5.5 years**.

I started programming when I was 10, learning from my father (35+ years in IT) and online resources.  
Every Thursday evening we went through Codecademy together — not just *what* works, but *why* it works, and *when it doesn’t*.

I don’t have formal degrees, but I do have a deep understanding of:
- how code behaves over time
- how systems evolve
- and how teams actually maintain software in the real world

I care a lot about **long-term codebases**, shared ownership, and building towards a product — not just shipping features.

## Flutter & architecture

Over the years I’ve worked with:
- **Stacked**
- **Provider**
- and now primarily **Bloc**, which fits how I like to structure and reason about state

My general preferences:
- Code should be readable six months later without context
- Long functions get split up early
- Nested `if` statements are a smell
- I actively try to move towards **SOLID-style boundaries** where it makes sense
- Fewer abstractions, but stronger and more intentional ones

I enjoy building **complex systems** and then reducing them to **clear, goal-driven solutions**.

---

## Packages & reuse

I’m currently working on my first Flutter packages.

They exist because I kept solving the **same problems across multiple projects**, and I prefer extracting solid, reusable solutions over copy-pasting patterns forever.

My focus with packages is:
- clear APIs
- explicit non-goals
- real-world constraints
- backwards compatibility
- documentation that explains decisions, not just usage

### Published

- **coffee_result**  
  Explicit, readable Result handling for Dart & Flutter.  
  Models success and failure without exceptions, nulls, or deeply nested conditionals.  

  [![Pub.dev](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/coffee_result?label=pub.dev&color=blue)](https://pub.dev/packages/coffee_result)
  [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-source-black)](https://github.com/HylkeReinders/flutter_result)

### In progress

- **runtime configuration**  
  Typed runtime config with environment switching and explicit overrides.

- **offline queue**  
  Persistent offline-first action queue with retries and conflict handling.

- **API error mapping**  
  Clear separation between transport errors, domain errors, and UI errors.

#### (Repositories are published once the API, documentation, and tests meet my own standards.)

## Testing (honest version)

I’m not going to pretend I *love* writing unit tests — I don’t.  
But I do write them, especially around critical logic and behavior.

- Not full TDD
- Tests where they add confidence
- Pragmatic over dogmatic

Production stability matters more to me than ideological purity.

---

## Backend & tooling

On the backend I usually work with **Laravel**, and I intentionally keep it boring.

- REST over GraphQL (by choice)
- Clear domain boundaries
- Authentication & authorization done properly
- Minimal framework magic

I prefer **reliable, well-understood tools** over flashy or bleeding-edge tech.
New things are fine — as long as they actually make sense.

---

## How I think about software

- Production-ready beats impressive
- Simple beats clever
- Explicit beats implicit
- Maintainable beats “nice abstraction”
- If something is missing, it’s probably intentional

I enjoy learning and trying new things — but only if they **hold up under scrutiny**.

## Coffee (important)

I really like coffee.  
Enough to get a **percolator tattoo** ☕  
Make of that what you will.
